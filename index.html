				<div class="column"><p class="intro">I thought instead of handing you a boring piece of 
				paper I would do something a little different and share with you this link to my online 
				resume. I made this for a class in college and have used it ever since. 
				Here you will find all the elements of a normal resume; however, I find this 
				version to be easier to access (especially with technology becoming more 
				and more popular!)<br><br>
				I hope you enjoy learning about me and see what an amazing 
				addition I would be to your team!</p></div>
